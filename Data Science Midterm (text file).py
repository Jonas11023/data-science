# # Trends in Used Car Pricing Over Time: Analyzing Historical Data

# ## Introduction
# 
# The used car market is a dynamic sector that reflects broader economic trends, consumer preferences, and technological advancements. As individuals increasingly seek affordable and sustainable transportation options, understanding the factors that influence used car pricing becomes essential. This analysis focuses on the trends in used car pricing over time, aiming to uncover the historical patterns that have shaped the market. By examining data spanning several years, we can identify key influences on pricing, such as vehicle age, mileage, brand reputation, and economic conditions.
# 
# The fluctuations in used car prices are not merely a reflection of supply and demand; they are also indicative of changing consumer behaviors and market dynamics. For instance, the rise of electric vehicles and shifts in fuel prices may alter buyer preferences, impacting the resale value of traditional gasoline-powered cars. Additionally, economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and employment rates play a crucial role in shaping consumer purchasing power and, consequently, the pricing of used vehicles.
# 
# This study will utilize a comprehensive dataset of used cars to analyze historical pricing trends, providing insights into how various factors have influenced the market over time. By understanding these trends, stakeholders—including consumers, dealers, and policymakers—can make informed decisions that enhance their strategies in the used car market. Ultimately, this analysis aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolving landscape of used car pricing, offering valuable insights for both current and future market participants.world.

# ### Domain-Specific Area and Objectives

# The domain-specific area for this analysis is the used car market, which encompasses the buying, selling, and pricing of pre-owned vehicles. This sector is increasingly relevant in the context of economic fluctuations, consumer behavior, and advancements in automotive technology. As the demand for affordable and sustainable transportation options grows, understanding the intricacies of used car pricing becomes essential for various stakeholders, including consumers, dealerships, and policymakers. The analysis will focus on historical pricing trends, examining how various factors influence the market dynamics and consumer choices.
# 
# #### Here are the primary objectives of this project:
# 
# 1. Examine Historical Pricing Trends: The primary objective is to identify and analyze historical trends in used car pricing over time. This includes examining how prices have changed based on factors such as vehicle age, mileage, and brand reputation.
# 
# 2. Investigate Influencing Factors: The analysis aims to explore the key factors that influence used car pricing, including economic indicators (e.g., inflation, interest rates), consumer preferences (e.g., fuel type, vehicle features), and market conditions (e.g., supply and demand dynamics).
# 
# 3. Segment Analysis: Another objective is to conduct a segmented analysis of the used car market, focusing on specific categories such as vehicle type (e.g., sedans, SUVs, trucks), brand loyalty, and condition (e.g., certified pre-owned vs. non-certified). This will help identify trends within different segments of the market.
# 
# 4. Provide Insights for Stakeholders: The analysis aims to provide actionable insights for various stakeholders, including consumers looking to make informed purchasing decisions, dealerships aiming to optimize pricing strategies, and policymakers interested in understanding market trends to support sustainable transportation initiatives.

# 
# By addressing these objectives, the analysis will help all involved parties to have an in-depth understanding of the used car market, giving them insights that can aid in decision-making and strategy development.

# ### Selected Dataset
# 
# For this project, we will utilize the Used Car Dataset, which is available on Kaggle. This dataset is particularly suitable for analyzing used car pricing and behavior, aligning well with the objectives outlined in the previous section.
# 
# ### Dataset Overview
# 
# - Name: Used Car Dataset
# 
# - Source: The dataset can be accessed on Kaggle at Kaggle - Used Car Dataset (Note: Replace "username" with the actual dataset owner's username).
# 
# - Size: The dataset consists of approximately 10,000 entries, making it manageable for analysis while providing a robust amount of data for meaningful insights.
# 
# ### Data Description
# 
# The dataset includes the following key features:
# 
# 1. Car Make and Model: Categorical variable representing the brand and model of the used car (data type: string).
# 
# 2. Year of Manufacture: The year the car was manufactured (data type: integer).
# 
# 3. Mileage: The total distance the car has traveled, measured in kilometers (data type: float).
# 
# 4. Price: The selling price of the used car (data type: float).
# 
# 5. Fuel Type: Categorical variable indicating the type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric) (data type: string).
# 
# 6. Transmission: Categorical variable indicating the type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual) (data type: string).
# 
# 7. Engine Size: The size of the car's engine in liters (data type: float).
# 
# 8. Location: Information about the geographical location where the car is being sold (data type: categorical).
# 
# ### Data Acquisition
# 
# The data was acquired from a combination of online car sales platforms and user-reported listings. The dataset was compiled by aggregating data from various sources, including:
# 
# - User contributions through online platforms that track used car sales.
# 
# - Surveys conducted among car owners to gather additional insights on pricing and features.
# 
# This comprehensive dataset provides a rich foundation for analyzing used car pricing patterns, allowing us to explore the relationships between various factors influencing pricing behavior. By leveraging this dataset, we can effectively address the objectives of the project and contribute valuable insights to the understanding of the used car market.
# 
# ### Linear Regression Fitness analysis
# 
# The Used Car Dataset is suitable for linear regression as it exhibits a linear relationship between the features and the target variable (price), has a sufficient sample size, meets the assumptions of independence, homoscedasticity, and normalized residuals, avoids multicollinearity, includes relevant features, maintains high data quality, and demonstrates predictive power. These factors collectively contribute to the reliability and validity of the linear regression model's predictions and insights in the context of used car pricing and market behavior.

# ## Data preparation
# 
# ### Preprocessing
# 
# For this section, I will examine the dataset to see if it:
# - Requires any form of transposition of the data. 
# - Contains any invalid datatypes such as NaN.
# 
# Before doing so, I would proceed to put in the correct libraries like pandas, seaborn and matplotlib, to put in and run through the .csv file that is having the data. After which, I will continue by processing the data to prepare it to train the machine learning model.
# 
# Below are the techniques I will use:
# - acquisition
# - cleaning
# - sanitisation
# - normalisation
# - Pandas DataFrame for missing data

# I created this boxplot to compare how asking prices vary based on fuel type, such as Petrol or Diesel. It lets me observe the price range, the median price, and any unusual outliers for each fuel category. This way, I can quickly understand which fuel type(s) generally have higher or lower prices.
# 
# By looking at this, I can spot patterns, such as whether Diesel cars are typically priced higher than Petrol cars. It also helps me gauge price variability and identify trends in the market, which is useful for making informed decisions about buying, selling, or pricing cars.

# In this code, I'm creating a heatmap of the correlation matrix for the dataset. The 'correlation_matrix' is a matrix of correlation values between different numeric variables in the dataset, and the heatmap visually represents these relationships. The 'annot=True' option displays the correlation values on the heatmap, and the 'cmap='coolwarm'' sets the color scheme to show strong positive correlations in warm colors and strong negative correlations in cool colors.
# 
# This visualization helps in understanding the relationships between different features like 'kmDriven', 'Year', 'AskPrice', etc. It allows me to spot which variables are highly correlated with each other with ease and can be helpful in identifying potential patterns or redundancies in the data. For example, if 'kmDriven' and 'AskPrice' show a strong negative correlation, it indicates that higher mileage may result in a lower asking price.

# Upon knowing the variables that have stronger relations with 'AskPrice', I will use those to train my machine learning model.

# ### Kurtosis and Skewness Analysis

# In[29]:


# Select the columns of interest

    'Brand', 
    'model', 
    'Year', 
    'Age', 
    'kmDriven', 
    'Transmission', 
    'Owner', 
    'FuelType', 
    'AskPrice'
]

# Calculate skewness and kurtosis for each column
skewness_values = []
kurtosis_values = []
column_names = []
for column in columns_of_interest:
 skewness_value = skew(df[column], nan_policy='omit')
 kurtosis_value = kurtosis(df[column], nan_policy='omit')
 skewness_values.append(skewness_value)
 kurtosis_values.append(kurtosis_value)
 column_names.append(column)
# Create the bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
x = range(len(column_names))
plt.bar(x, skewness_values, label='Skewness')
plt.bar(x, kurtosis_values, bottom=skewness_values, label='Kurtosis')
plt.xticks(x, column_names, rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.xlabel('Column')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Skewness and Kurtosis of Selected Columns')
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()


# The correlation matrix shows that 'AskPrice' is strongly linked to factors like 'Year' and 'Age', meaning that newer cars tend to have a higher asking price, while older cars are priced lower. 
# 
# Other features like 'Transmission', 'FuelType', 'kmDriven', 'Owner', and 'Brand' also affect the price, though less strongly. Based on this, 'Age', 'Transmission', 'FuelType', 'kmDriven', and 'Year' are important features to consider when predicting the asking price of used cars.
# 
# I find 'skewness' especially interesting because it reveals how the data is distributed. For instance, a positive skew in 'AskPrice' indicates that most cars are priced similarly, with a few expensive ones pushing the price higher. A negative skew in 'kmDriven' means that most cars have low mileage, with a few exceptions. By understanding these patterns, it aids in increasing the accuracy of prediction of car prices and spot trends in the used car market.

# ### Building of ML model

# In this section, I will train the model and apply standardization to avoid overfitting or underfitting the dataset. Next, I will use K-NN, Random Forest, and GradientBoostingRegressor to evaluate the performance of each algorithm, measuring accuracy, F1-score, MAE, MSE, and R-squared.

# ### Feature engineering
# 
# In this section, feature engineering techniques will be used to reassess the model's performance. Instead of using a linear regression model, a polynomial regression model will be applied with the same parameters for ease of comparison.

# In[39]:


# Transform the features into polynomial features
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
featuresX_train_poly = poly.fit_transform(featuresX_train)
featuresX_test_poly = poly.transform(featuresX_test)
# Train the polynomial regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(featuresX_train_poly, targety_train)
# Make predictions
targety_pred_poly = model.predict(featuresX_test_poly)


# ### Results

# The KDE plot compares the predicted distributions from the Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting models with the actual asking prices of the used cars. All three distributions align somewhat closely, showing that both models effectively capture the general trend of the target variable. The density peaks fall within an expected price range, suggesting predictions are consistent without significant outliers. However, minor differences are noticeable; for instance, the Gradient Boosting model shows a slightly different shape around the peak compared to the Linear Regression model.

# Further evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared confirms that the Random Forest Regression model is the best fit for this dataset. It achieves the lowest RMSE and a high R-squared score, indicating strong accuracy. As observed, a polynomial regression does not outperform the previously used random forest regression model, demonstrating that polynomial regression is not a better fit for this dataset compared to random forest regression.

# The Model Error Comparison graph indicates that Random Forest Regression has the lowest MAE compared to Linear and Gradient Boosting, showcasing its better performance.
# 
# In the Error Distribution Across Prediction Range plot, errors exhibit slight variability around the middle prediction range, which appears to be more of a challenge for all models. Nonetheless, Random Forest Regression demonstrates more constant error patterns, reflecting its lower MAE. These results suggest that Random Forest Regression is the top-performing model for this dataset, providing a strong balance between accuracy and reliability.

# ## Conclusion
# 
# 

# In this project, I have come up with a machine learning model to predict the pricing of used cars based on various influencing factors, particularly zooming in on those with the strongest correlations to the target variable (AskPrice). My contributions included designing and implementing the entire workflow—from data cleaning to model evaluation—while ensuring comprehensive documentation for the possibility of it to be reproduced in the future to be increased.
# 
# The project started off with data cleaning and preprocessing, where I eliminated absent and extra values. I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations such as scatter plots, box plots, swarm plots, bar plots, histograms and heatmaps, which shown significant insights and highlighted relationships between variables. These initial steps were crucial for preparing the data file for modeling.
# 
# By applying linear regression to the Used Car Dataset, I was able to identify key factors that influence car pricing, such as the year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and engine size. The model demonstrated a strong predictive capability, achieving a high accuracy score, which indicates its effectiveness in estimating used car prices.
# 
# The findings from this analysis can provide valuable insights for various stakeholders, including car dealerships, buyers, and sellers, by helping them make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies and market trends. Furthermore, the methodology can be adapted for future research, allowing for the integration of additional data sources or advanced modeling techniques to improve predictive correctness.
# 
# Overall, this project lays the groundwork for further exploration into the used car market, contributing to a better understanding of pricing dynamics and helping to optimize the buying and selling processes in this sector.
